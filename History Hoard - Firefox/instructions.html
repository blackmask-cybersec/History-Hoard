        <li>The 'populate' button fetches every URL and its corresponding visits currently stored
            by the browser and adds it to the extension's own database on your computer. Click this button 
            the first time you run the extension. Note - On slower devices, this process could
        take several minutes and will likely cause your browser to stutter. So plan accordingly.</li>
        <li>
            Every time the browser launches, the extension grabs the latest 2,500 URLs and their 
            visits stored by the browser and updates the extension database accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you think you've made over 2,500 visits since the last time you launched Firefox, use 
            the 'populate' button again to get all URLs and visits stored by the browser.
        </li>
        <li>Usually, you would only need to use the 'populate' button once i.e. the time you first
            download the extension. The extension should manage the rest.
        </li>
        <li>As of April 2022, Firefox allows an extension to store up to 2GB of data before evicting it. This would mean 
            that your data could be stored on your computer for decades hassle-free.
        </li>
        <li>Alas, Firefox could change their browser storage limits and eviction criteria.
            Therefore, I recommend using the export functionality every 6 months or so to ensure your data
            remains safe with you.
